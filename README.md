The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic paper-and-pencil game where two players take turns marking X and O symbols on a 3x3 grid. This implementation of Tic Tac Toe was developed using the C programming language. It utilizes fundamental concepts of C, such as data types, functions, and arrays, to create a command-line version of the game.
